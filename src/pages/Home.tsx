        I am an avid coder and am excited to write efficient and scalable code. I graduated Spring 2020 at the University of Central Missouri with a BS in Computer Science. As a student employee, I was a tutor and teaching assistant for Discrete Mathematics. I had a three month internship working as a contractor for the United States Air Force where I researched Machine Learning solutions to provided problems.

        For 2 years and 10 months, I was employed as a part of the modernization team at Yellow Corporated. My responsibilities included updating their deprecated IBM framework to Java and SQL Server. I was also involved in code reviews and deploying updates to the development and production environments.
